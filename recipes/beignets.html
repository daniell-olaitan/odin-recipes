        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Beignets are delicious, pillowy pastries made with fried
            dough that are usually connected to French cooking.
            Usually square or rectangular in shape, these fluffy pastries
            are heavily sprinkled with powdered sugar. They are a delightful
            treat since they have a crunchy exterior and a light, airy interior.
            In New Orleans, beignets are a beloved dessert that are best savored
            with good company and a dash of sweetness.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Yeast</li>
            <li>Evaporated Milk</li>
            <li>Sugars</li>
            <li>Eggs</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Flour</li>
            <li>Shortening</li>
            <li>Oil</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Dissolve yeast in warm water. Pour into a large bowl 
                and stir in evaporated milk, white sugar, eggs, and salt.
                Add 4 cups flour and beat until smooth.
            </li>
            <li>Mix in shortening. Mix in remaining 3 cups flour. Cover and
                refrigerate for at least 2 hours, or up to 24 hours.
            </li>
            <li> Roll dough out on floured surface to 1/8-inch thick. Cut into 2 1/2-inch squares.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a deep pot to 360 degrees F (180 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Fry beignets in batches until browned and puffed. (If beignets sink and do not
                pop up, oil is not hot enough.) Remove from oil with a slotted spoon and drain 
                on paper towels.
            </li>
            <li>Shake confectioners' sugar over hot beignets. Serve immediately.</li>
        </ol>
