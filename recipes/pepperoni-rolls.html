        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup warm water (100 degrees F/40 degrees C)</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon white sugar</li>
            <li>1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast</li>
            <li>5 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>¾ cup white sugar</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
            <li>2 eggs, beaten</li>
            <li>½ cup butter, melted</li>
            <li>1 (8 ounce) package sliced pepperoni</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Stir together 1 cup warm water and 1/2 teaspoon sugar in a small bowl until sugar dissolves.
                Sprinkle yeast over water; let stand for 5 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>Mix flour, 3/4 cup sugar, and salt in a large bowl. Stir in yeast mixture, beaten eggs, and
                melted butter until dough comes together. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and
                 knead until smooth and elastic, about 8 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>Place dough into a greased bowl and turn to coat with oil. Cover with a light cloth; let rise in
                a warm place until doubled in volume, about 1 1/2 hours.
            </li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a cookie sheet.</li>
            <li>Punch down dough; divide into 20 equal pieces about the size of a golf ball. Using your hands,
                flatten each piece into a small rectangle, about 4 inches square.
            </li>
            <li>Place 3 overlapping slices of pepperoni down the center of each dough square. Place another row
                of 3 pepperoni slices next to the first. Roll dough around pepperoni, pinch the edges closed,
                 and place rolls on the prepared cookie sheet.
            </li>
            <li> Bake rolls in the preheated oven until bottoms are lightly browned and tops are barely golden,
                14 to 16 minutes.
            </li>
        </ol>
