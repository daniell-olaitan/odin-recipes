        <h2>Description</h2>
         <p>A popular side dish, southern coleslaw has just the right amount of crispness, creaminess, and
            tanginess. Shredded carrots and cabbage are combined with a dressing that usually consists of
            sugar, vinegar, mayonnaise, and mustard for a light and refreshing slaw. As a result, the
            coleslaw achieves a delicious balance between the crispness of the fresh veggies and the
            richness of the dressing. It's a mainstay at barbecues and other Southern get-togethers,
            giving a cool and tasty accent to a range of foods.
